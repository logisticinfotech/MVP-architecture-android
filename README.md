**What is Android MVP?**

**Model** :- Model manage data components that provide functionality like fetch, store, sort, and expose data.

**View** :- View manage user interface actions.

**Presenter** :- Presenter works as an intermediator between View and Model. Presenter accept event from View, analyse action, get required data from Model and send data back to View for update UI.

**Why do we need MVP or any structure?**

While working with any long-term project, it needs to be scalable, less complicated. MVP makes it possible by dividing code structure into three different layers (MODEL – PRESENTER – VIEW).
